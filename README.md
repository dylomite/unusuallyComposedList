# Unusually Composed List

This project is a quick POC (Proof of Concept)

- **Unusually:** not a boring way (hopefullyðŸ˜„) to present items
- **Composed:** built using 100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose âœ¨
- **List:** items are displayed on a lis... actually two lists that are coordinated together! ðŸ¤–
